# The Bean (Bean23)
The Bean, is a project, that changed IMIBUKS life forever. From it's popularity, and the amount of bugs that had to be squashed for its existance, on the developers side, it was an unique experience, that was far from his comfort zone.

The Bean allowed it's users to go on a journey, to keep pushing themselves in the RIGHT direction, and proceed a revolutionary mechanic called _jumping_, allowing them to move past life threathening foods, and obstecles.

But what made The Bean special? What made it so popular? There were many factors that allowed this, simple concept, to use its potential, and impact the lives of hundreds. And how can Bean23 improve on the previous versions of the bean?

# What made The Bean popular
Lets discuss, the key areas, that allowed the older versions, (from the 1st all the way to beanz), to be an experience that people enjoyed.

## Accsessibilty / Ease of Use
One of the key factors allowing in The Beans widespread adoption, was its accsessibility, and ease of use. It was not difficult to grasp, your thumb on the screen, and tap it, to leap over the obstecles. 

And since it was a website, it allowed anyone, regardless of device, to acsess this game. Whether its an iPhone, Phone, Laptop, PC, Smart Fridge, or other, it gave the opporchunity to who wished to take advantage of it, to play it. No complex downloads, just simplicity. The user had to simply head over to [debean.github.io](debean.github.io) and start playing.

## Advertisement
At IMIBUKS, we bellive that everyone should play The Bean. So we advertised and marketed The Bean as much as was pysically possible, in the real world. We would spread the words, and some of the users would spread the words to others. 

While the uneducated haters may complain about its frequency, and the reaction that occours in their brain, when their ear hears the word "debean.github.io", we think of it more positively. We were desperate, and there was no other option. And this was the only reason, that The Bean became played by over 155+ unique people.

## Simplicity
Once you enter the game, you do not need to google a tutorial, or ask someone for help. (Partly because no tutorials existed...) It was super intuitive, and addicting. It usually doesn't last that long. You can play it when you are bored, or waiting for something or someone. 

## Intertivity
Despite the simple mechanics, and admittedly, low graphics, it had interactivity. The coins that the player could collect, and use to purchase other skins, which were also a status symbol, gave a reason for a player to keep on playing (other than grinding highscores). 

While the graphics were not triple AAA quality, it had its own charm. The revolutionary, "emotions" that the bean would display in later versions (of the older versions), made the user more attached to their in-game character. For example, When the in-game character hit the wall, it got sad. It would open its mouth to eat foods. it was a critical update in The Bean[Beanz]

# How Bean23 is better
Bean23 is the future, and beyond of The Bean. We take all the features you loved from the classical features, and bring back some of the missing ones, and add some much needed features and graphics improvements, in order to bring this dying game back to life.

## Developement
The project, codenamed "Bean23", is IMIBUKS attempt to revive, and encourage users to play The Bean once more. It is built on similar technologies, using [kaboom](kaboomjs.com), and static HTML to render it. However, Bean23 uses the later version of [Kaboom V3000](kaboomjs.com), allowing for increased preformance, and other features. It is also more clean, and uses functions, allowing for modifiable code, and also easy cheating.

## Homescreen
Bean23 finally adds a critical component of a functional, finished game. Bean23 has a beautiful background, and a custom designed buttons. You enter the homescreen from the game by clicking on the text.

You can finally **change skins** by clicking the Skins button on the homescreen. In there, you can see the amount of BC (bean Coins) you have. And by clicking on a skin, you can either select it (if purchased, will be prompted) or purchase the skin. However, if you lack enough money, it will block you from purchasing

## Bean Coins (not coins)
Bean Coins are back, like the old version [dbn](dbn.imibuks.repl.co). However, we have redesigned the coins to currency notes, of different colours. It was designed using PowerPoint, and a flaticon template of "money". There are 4 values of money, _(1BC, 2BC, 5BC, 10BC)_. Coins can be used to purchase skins

1BC is 3x more likely
2BC is 2x more likely
5BC is 1x more likely
10BC is 0.33-0.50x more likely

## Graphical upgrades
One of the key areas that Bean23 attempts to improve is the graphics. As mentioned before, The Bean had very basic graphics. But we have indeed improved it by 70%.

### Platform
The platform is no longer one solid rectangle. It is 3 solid rectangles, at different shades of colour. The first rectangle is a small, lighter rectangle, that helps give a feeling of light, and depth in what was just a rectangle. And the bottom rectangle is darker, to add a 3D effect, and also make it look like there is lighting

### Obstecles
The obstecles are now based on a simple PowerPoint image template, that adds some realistic* shadows. The obstecles can also randomly be darker or ligther than the colour originally selected by the code.

### Visual indicators
The previous versions used a simple, large textbox at the top, to display all the necessary infomation. It used the format `HP:800 S:426 C:41`. It was basic, but worked well enough.

But, after carefull research, our design team concluded that the healthbar did not meet the high standards IMIBUKS has, especially in the year 2023. So we use red/yellow/green coloured rectangles, to display this infomation in a more familiar way. It is located the top, allowing for easy viewiing.

We also used icons to display other infomation such as effects (speed/slowness), instead of using text. Text is great, but visual indicators help declutter the UI, and bring more attention to the bean, jumping over obstecles.

According to researches, the improved visual indicators such as the smaller text, visual healtbar, effect indicator, allows for the average player to go 40% further, and makes the experience 88% better.

## Improved foods
The new food system, is not just better under the hood (using functions to clean up the code), but improves the ingame experience, with tons of new foods.

- KFC/Chicken - **1/2+HP** _Speed_
- Kokonut - **1+HP** 
- Banana Peel **-1HP** 
- Rotten (Apple) **1/2-HP** _Slowness_

The addition of dangerous foods, and effects, makes the gameplay more interesting. Now, the food that you eat, can effect you in a positive or negetive way. And the amount of health you gain or loose form the Rotten or KFC is based on luck.

# The Future of The Bean
We hope the future of the bean is strong, and still sucsessfull. The Bean has not recived an update in 4+ months, so IMIBUKS is working hard to develop a more fun, exciting, and interactive sequel to "The Bean", with new features.

> Bean23 is still in early developement, and many more features are yet to come. You may experience many bugs, but they will (Insha Allah) be polished out and fixed by the time this reaches offical developement.

It is now in *beta* stage, so it is playable, but features such as _coins_ and _skins_ are not implemented  yet. But the bare essentials such as
- Foods (many new foods and mechanics added)
- Obstecles
- Backgrounds/Platform
- Fail screen (death was not implemented during the 1st week of developement)
- LocalStorage
- Easy cheating and hacking
